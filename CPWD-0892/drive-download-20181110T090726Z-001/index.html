				<p>The word sea is often used interchangeably with "ocean" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. 
				Saline water covers approximately 360,000,000 km2 (140,000,000 sq mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.
				The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored. 
				The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).</p>

					<p>There are countless options for choosing an intake manifold. Some intakes will help you make power down low, while others will help with top end power. 
						Choosing the right intake is a matter of your application and the kind of horsepower your engine will potentially make. 
						We'll give you Intake Manifold basics and then get more technical at the end.</p>
